//! A library for parsing and manipulating Flattened Device Tree (FDT) blobs.
//!
//! This library provides a comprehensive API for working with FDTs, including:
//!
//! - A read-only API for parsing and traversing FDTs without memory allocation.
//! - A read-write API for creating and modifying FDTs in memory.
//! - Support for applying device tree overlays.
//! - Outputting device trees in DTS source format.
//!
//! The library is written purely in Rust and is `#![no_std]` compatible. If
//! you don't need the Device Tree manipulation functionality, the library is
//! also no-`alloc`-compatible.
//!
//! ## Read-Only API
//!
//! The read-only API is centered around the [`Fdt`](fdt::Fdt) struct, which
//! provides a safe, zero-copy view of an FDT blob. You can use this API
//! to traverse the device tree, inspect nodes and properties, and read
//! property values.
//!
//! Note that because the [`Fdt`](fdt::Fdt) struct is zero-copy, certains
//! operations such as node or lookups run in linear time. If you need to
//! perform these operations often and you can spare extra memory, it might be
//! beneficial to convert from [`Fdt`](fdt::Fdt) to
//! [`DeviceTree`](model::DeviceTree) first.
//!
//! ## Read-Write API
//!
//! The read-write API is centered around the [`DeviceTree`](model::DeviceTree)
//! struct, which provides a mutable, in-memory representation of a device tree.
//! You can use this API to create new device trees from scratch, modify
//! existing ones, and serialize them back to an FDT blob.
//!
//! Internally it is built upon hash maps, meaning that most lookup and
//! modification operations run in constant time.
//!
//! ## Device Tree Overlays
//!
//! This library also provides support for applying device tree overlays. See
//! the [`DeviceTree::apply_overlay`](model::DeviceTree::apply_overlay) method
//! for more information.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ```
//! use ritm_device_tree::fdt::Fdt;
//! use ritm_device_tree::model::{DeviceTree, DeviceTreeNode, DeviceTreeProperty};
//!
//! // Create a new device tree from scratch.
//! let mut tree = DeviceTree::new(DeviceTreeNode::new("/"));
//!
//! // Add a child node to the root.
//! let child = DeviceTreeNode::builder("child")
//!     .property(DeviceTreeProperty::new("my-property", "hello\0"))
//!     .build();
//! tree.root_mut().add_child(child);
//!
//! // Serialize the device tree to a DTB.
//! let dtb = tree.to_dtb();
//!
//! // Parse the DTB with the read-only API.
//! let fdt = Fdt::new(&dtb).unwrap();
//!
//! // Find the child node and read its property.
//! let child_node = fdt.find_node("/child").unwrap().unwrap();
//! let prop = child_node.property("my-property").unwrap().unwrap();
//! assert_eq!(prop.as_str().unwrap(), "hello");
//!
//! // Display the DTS
//! println!("{}", fdt);
//! ```
